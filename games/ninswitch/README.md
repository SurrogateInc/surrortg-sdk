# Ninswitch games

Ninswitch directory contains three games:

- **game_simple.py** which contains code only for the Switch controls
- **game_imagerec.py** which the same as game_simple.py, but it also has an image
    recognition sample code
- **game_irlkart.py** which contains the full code for the irlkart game

They games are made possible by [gdsports](https://github.com/gdsports)'s [NSGadget_Pi](https://github.com/gdsports/NSGadget_Pi)
library, which forwards the controls from Rapberry Pi to Switch.

## Hardware setup

Hardware requirements:

- Switch console
- Adafruit Trinket M0
- HDMI capture device
- HDMI cable
- Micro USB cable
- jumber cables

Following [NSGadget_Pi](https://github.com/gdsports/NSGadget_Pi)'s setup:

1. Setup Trinket M0:
    - Download the [firmware](https://github.com/gdsports/NSGadget_Pi/blob/master/firmware/NSGadget.ino.f9e9ee2.trinket_m0.bin.uf2)
    - Plug in the Trinket M0 to the computer
    - Double tap the Trinket M0 reset button
    - When the TRINKETBOOT USB drive appears, drop the UF2 file on to the drive
    - Wait a few seconds until the Trinket M0 reboots
2. Do the wiring between Trinket M0 and Raspberry Pi:  
   **BAT** to **5V0**  
   **Gnd** to **Gnd**  
   **RX(3)** to **D14(TXD)**  
   **TX(4)** to **D15(RXD)**
3. Connect Trinket M0 to Switch dock with the Micro USB cable
4. Connect Raspberry Pi to Switch dock through HDMI Capture device and HDMI cable

## Software setup

Software requirements:

- Surrortg installed
- Knowledge on how to run different games inside `/games` directory
- Audio setup done

The image recognition needs a loopback device set up to `/dev/video21`:

1. First install srtg-watcherstream with `sudo apt install srtg-watcherstream`
2. Use `sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf` to add another loopback device:
    - Replace `video_nr=20` with `video_nr=20,21`
    - Save and exit
3. Run `sudo rmmod v4l2loopback && sudo modprobe v4l2loopback` to update configurations

To install everything correctly on Raspberry Pi:

1. First change to the ninswitch directory with `cd games/ninswitch`
2. Install the Python requirements by running `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the setup script with `sudo ./setup.sh`
4. Use `sudo nano /boot/config.txt` to add `dtoverlay=disable-bt` as the last line
    of config.txt. Then save and exit.
5. Change the raspi config with `sudo raspi-config`:
    - Select `Interfacing Options`
    - Select `P6 Serial`
    - Disable the login shell
    - Enable the serial interface
    - Exit raspi-config
6. Reboot with `sudo reboot`

## Image recognition

**game_imagerec.py** has a sample code how to detect a flag from the loopback
device stream.

This is possible through `surrortg/image_recognition`'s AsyncVideoCapture,
which reads individual frames from the loopback device stream in a separate
`image_rec_main`-task:

```python
from surrortg.image_recognition import AsyncVideoCapture, get_pixel_detector

...

    async def image_rec_main(self):
        # create capture
        self.cap = await AsyncVideoCapture.create("/dev/video21")

        ...

        # loop through frames
        i = 0
        async for frame in self.cap.frames():
            ...
```

The flag is detected with the help of `get_pixel_detector`-function.

It receives a list of spesific pixels from the flag, as pixel coordinates and colors,
and outputs a function that returns `True/False` based on whether the input frame
has similar pixels.

The color match sensitivity can be modified with `close=` -parameter, which defaults
to 25, smaller value requires closer match for each pixel to return `True`.

```python
# sample detectable
# ((x, y), (r, g, b))
FLAG_PIXELS = [
    ((206, 654), (14, 14, 12)),
    ((215, 655), (254, 254, 254)),
    ((223, 654), (11, 11, 11)),
    ((222, 663), (252, 252, 252)),
    ((214, 662), (0, 0, 0)),
    ((206, 661), (253, 251, 252)),
    ((205, 670), (20, 18, 19)),
    ((213, 670), (252, 252, 252)),
    ((222, 669), (0, 0, 0)),
    ((201, 650), (2, 2, 4)),
]

...

        # get detector
        has_flag = get_pixel_detector(FLAG_PIXELS)

        # loop through frames
        i = 0
        async for frame in self.cap.frames():
            # detect
            if has_flag(frame):
                logging.info("Has flag!")

```

### Creating custom image recognition

#### Save frame

First, you need to have a sample frame from the loopback device.

This can be done by changing `SAVE_FRAMES`variable from `False` to `True` from `game_imagerec.py`.
Then run the game until the point your detectable object is seen and stop the game.

You should then revert `SAVE_FRAMES` back to `False` to increase the frame processing
rate and prevent filling up the SD-card.

Alternatively, you can use the input `capture_frame` while running the game
through the site (needs to be bound in dashboard). to capture individual
frames as opposed to persistently capturing frames.

Assuming you have a working ssh connection, these images can be copied from the
raspi to current directory on your PC with scp:  
`scp -r <USER>@<RASPI_ADDRESS>:/opt/srtg-python/imgs/ .`

#### Generate pixel values

On your PC Python, install OpenCV by running `pip install opencv-contrib-python`

Then, you are able to create custom image recognition code by running pixel_detect
-program:  
`python surrortg/image_recognition/pixel_detect.py <PATH_TO_FRAME> <DETECTABLE_NAME>`

You can now click the interesting pixels that are included inside the detectable.
Press `Q` to exit.

This process should print a sample code to the terminal, an example output:

```
$ python surrortg/image_recognition/pixel_detect.py 103.jpg coin

Click the pixels to detect, example script is printed during the usage
press Q to exit

Printed values can be used together with 'get_pixel_detector'-function
For example:


import asyncio
from surrortg.image_recognition import AsyncVideoCapture, get_pixel_detector

# ((x, y), (r, g, b))
COIN_PIXELS = [
    ((70, 656), (209, 171, 0)),
    ((73, 665), (255, 231, 16)),
    ((80, 665), (247, 205, 5)),
    ((67, 668), (240, 206, 13)),
    ((60, 656), (200, 197, 58)),
]


SOURCE = "/dev/video21"

async def main():
    # create coin detector
    has_coin = get_pixel_detector(COIN_PIXELS)

    # create capture device
    async with await AsyncVideoCapture.create(SOURCE) as frames:
        async for frame in frames:
            # print if coin is detected
            if has_coin(frame):
                print("has coin")
            else:
                print("doesn't have coin")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Setting up with Reset Pin

Trinket M0's have been found to be quite tempermental with some controls.
It is possible to add reset functionality so it can be reset on a button
press and between every round of your game. Continue using the `game_simple.py`
if you decide to use the reset pin.

### Hardware Addendum

During the wiring, add a new jumper to the Trinket and Pi:
   **RST** to **GPIO22**

*NOTE* - Any unused GPIO pin on the pi can be used but will require updating
the script (Number in the script will be the GPIO number, not pin number).
